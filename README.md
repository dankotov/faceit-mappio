# FACEIT Mappio

> Chrome extension for the FACEIT CSGO esports platform that displays everyone's map-related information in the match room letting you make more educated decisions during the veto process

The idea behind creating this extension is to provide more information about the match players directly in the match room. I usually play with a stack of friends and often I am the captain of the team. Every time I got to the veto stage, I found myself openning the opponents' profiles to check their map statistics. FACEIT web pages take notoriously long to load, so I frequently missed the first couple of veto picks. Hoping to resolve this issue, I set out to create Mappio.

## Features

### Match room player map statistics

This is the MVP feature of this extension. Mappio appends each player's map statistics to their player card in the match room.
