# FACEIT Mappio

> Chrome extension for the FACEIT CSGO esports platform that displays everyone's map-related information in the match room letting you make more educated decisions during the veto process.

The idea behind creating this extension is to provide more information about the match players directly in the match room. I usually play with a stack of friends and I am often the captain of the team. Every time I get to the veto stage, I find myself openning the opponents' profiles to check their map statistics. FACEIT web pages take notoriously long to load, so I frequently miss the first couple of veto picks. Hoping to resolve this issue, I created Mappio.

## Features

### Map Statistics

This is the MVP feature of this extension. Mappio appends each player's map statistics to their player card in the match room.
